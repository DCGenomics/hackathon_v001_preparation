# hackathon_v001_preparation
These are the materials used to plan the January, 2015 NCBI/ADDS Hackathon 

Item 1:  Initial Scientific Goals of the Hackathon.  
  + We expected these to change, and they did.

Item 2:  Daily Schedule and Organization for Hackathon
  + We thought this might be a bit too structured for a hackathon, but it was very popular.  
  
More material (surveys, logistcal things, etc) may be added due to perceived demand.
